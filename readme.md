### Suggest Features

New feature suggestions or UI improvements are always welcome.

This project is powered by open source volunteers, so we have a limited amount of development resource to address all requests. We will certainly make best efforts to progress (particularly for those with strong community upvotes).

### Code Contributions

Code contributions are always welcome! Just try to follow our coding style: Coding Style Wiki coming soon.

If you plan to contribute, please create a Github issue (or comment on the relevant existing issue) so we can help coordinate with upcoming release plans.

For a general workflow, see Github's guide to [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

Pull requests (PRs) should generally be for discrete issues (i.e. one issue per PR please) and be clean to merge against the current master branch. It would also be helpful if you can confirm what testing has been done (specific O/S targets if applicable).

A usual naming approach for feature branches is `issue-###`. Include the issue number in your commit message / pull request description to link the PR to the original issue.
